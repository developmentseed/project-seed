// This is the main application component where you add your app-specific features
// that are independent of the component library choice. This includes:
//
// - Map components (Mapbox, MapLibre, etc.)
// - Custom widgets and components
// - Application-specific layouts
// - Business logic components
// - Data visualization components
// - Any other features not tied to the UI component library
//
// The component library setup (Chakra UI, USWDS, etc.) is handled in main.tsx,
// while this file focuses on your application's core functionality.
